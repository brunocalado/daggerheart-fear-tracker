## Features

- **Automatic Sync:** The tracker automatically syncs with the Daggerheart system's Fear resource. Changes in the character sheet update the tracker, and changes in the tracker update the sheet.
- **Visual Effects:**
  - **Glow & Breath:** Active fear tokens pulse and breathe to draw attention.
  - **Tremor:** The bar shakes briefly when Fear increases, adding impact to the moment.
- **Customizable:**
  - **Themes:** Choose from various styles like **Nuclear**, **Ghost**, Skull, Blood Drop, Stone, and more.
  - **Size:** Easily switch between **Small**, **Normal**, and **Large** sizes to fit your screen.
  - **Width:** Adjust how wide the bar is.
- **Drag & Drop:** Place the tracker anywhere on your screen. Positions are saved per user.
- **Visibility Control:** The GM can toggle visibility for everyone. Players can also hide it locally for themselves if needed.

## Configuration

Go to the **"Configure Settings"** menu in Foundry VTT -> **"Module Settings"** tab.

* **Theme:** Choose how the tracker looks. Now includes **Nuclear** and **Ghost** themes!
* **Tracker Size:** Select **Small**, **Normal**, or **Large**. (Recommended: Normal).
* **Tracker Bar Width:** Adjust the width in pixels.
* **Pulse/Breathing Effects:** Enable or disable animations.
* **Pulse Glow Color:** Pick a custom color for the glowing effect (outer glow).
* **Active Pip Tint Color:** Apply a color tint to the active tokens (e.g., `red`, `#00ff00`). Uses multiply blending to dye the texture naturally.
* **Custom Images:** If using the "Custom" theme, you can upload your own images here.
* **Hide System Bar:** Automatically sets the Daggerheart system's Fear bar setting to 'hide' to avoid visual clutter and duplication.

## Macro: Reset Position

If you lost the tracker off-screen or want to center it perfectly at the top of your window, you don't need a complex script anymore.

Simply create a new Script Macro with this single command:

```javascript
// Resets the tracker to the top-center of your screen
FearTracker.Reset();
```

You can also specify coordinates if you prefer a specific spot (X, Y):

```javascript
// Moves tracker to 100px from left and 100px from top
FearTracker.Reset(100, 100);
```
